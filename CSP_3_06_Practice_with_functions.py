#takes in a number as an argument and returns that number multiplied by 2.
def denominator():
    pass

#Takes in two arguments. multiply the first argument by negative 1. Then
#return the modified first argument added and subtracted by the second argument.

#takes in three numbers as arguments. The first and third multiplied together then
#multiplied by 4.Then subtract that result from the second argument squared.
#Return the overall result.
